### **Author:** Kevin Tu  
### **Date:** March 2025  

## **Overview**  
This case study analyzes LAFCâ€™s Food & Beverage (F&B) sales performance to identify inefficiencies in pricing strategies, vendor management, and product mix. The goal was to develop data-driven recommendations to increase revenue per event by **10-15%** through optimized pricing, vendor realignment, and strategic menu adjustments.

## **Key Challenges Identified**
- **Inefficient Pricing Strategy:** Current pricing does not fully reflect real-time demand fluctuations.  
- **Vendor Performance Gaps:** Some vendors generate **30-40% less revenue** despite high foot traffic.  
- **Product Mix Inefficiencies:** Certain items dominate sales while others underperform, leading to suboptimal inventory allocation.  

## **Key Insights & Recommendations**
âœ” **Dynamic Pricing Optimization** â€“ Adjust prices based on demand trends, increasing high-demand item pricing by **10-15%**.  
âœ” **Vendor Optimization** â€“ Remove low-performing vendors and redistribute high-revenue sellers to high-traffic areas.  
âœ” **Menu Adjustments** â€“ Optimize inventory space for high-revenue item categories and introduce bundled pricing.  

## **Projected Impact**
ðŸ“ˆ **+$100K per event** â€“ Implementing these changes is projected to **increase F&B revenue per event by 10-15%**.  
ðŸ“Š **Data-Driven Decision Making** â€“ Regression analysis shows that for every **$1 increase in price, revenue grows by ~$1.91**.  

## **Data & Methodology**
